# Governance Tracker

This is a simple to use Delegation dashboard that shows who’s giving voting power to who. We wanted to make it easier to understand the flow of voting power between voters and delegates. In the dashboard you can see a breakdown of voters and how much they’ve delegated. The graph is pulling data from Uniswap but could be applied to other governance systems as well. The delegation data is gathered from the Uniswap token contract (from block 0 to the current block) and there are also additional filters to look through verified delegates.
